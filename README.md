Copilot-js-bing.Ai is a Telegram bot that uses artificial intelligence to interact with users.

## Description

This project is a Telegram bot that uses AI to communicate with users. The bot is able to translate text into English and then use the AI model to generate a response. After receiving the response from the AI, the bot translates it back into Russian and sends it to the user. The bot also offers users additional features, such as getting more detailed information or translating text into English.

## Libraries used

The code uses the `Telegraf` libraries to create a Telegram bot, `free-translate` to translate text, and `bingai-js` to interact with AI.

## Starting and stopping the bot

The bot is launched using the `bot.launch()` method, and it can be stopped using the `SIGINT` or `SIGTERM` signals. To start the bot, you can use the `npm start` command.
